# Lab-Week-9-Reflection

Lab 9 proved to be more difficult than I expected and my teammates were really helpful in teaching me how to do each task.
We did have to look at some of the modules to guide us through the tasks.
I think this lab will prove to be very helpful for the upcoming assignment and the the final test, which is just 3 weeks away
